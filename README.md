# perfect-mazes 
###Intro to CS Class Final Project

A python program that makes use of several algorithms to generate a maze with a START/END POINT, and PICKS UP A KEY along the way

#### START point is at the top left - point (1,1)
#### END POINT is randomly generated
#### KEY is randomly generated

#### Perfect Maze is created based on those points
#### path is then shown 


## ** THINGS TO NOTE: ** 

#### 1) The stack operations and maze objects are all definded under the Maze class, therefore there is no myStack class
#### 2) There is ALWAYS a defined singular path to the exit, however, sometimes blue path squares are not drawn on all of the cells and sometimes skips squares or sections. But do know that there are NO circles in the maze and there is always a clear path from start to finish with a key along the way (you can always trace the singular path if you look for it :) )
#### 3) all questions from the lab are in this one mazefinal.py file and not in separate files
